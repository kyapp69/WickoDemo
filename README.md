This project implements a Renko variant that includes High and Low wicks (hence the name "Wicko") as opposed to standard Renko "bricks" that only have Open and Close values.  Careful attention has been paid to properly handling edge cases, such as gapped ticks that need to lay down multiple Wicko's in a single go.

To run the project, please go to [http://www.scichart.com/](http://www.scichart.com/) and download a trial or paid version then install and register that version on your system.
